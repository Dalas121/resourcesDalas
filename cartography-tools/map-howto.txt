This directory contains the resources needed to edit the Wesnoth main
map and variants thereof with the GIMP.

The most important file is great-continent.xcf.  This started out as a
straight conversion of mapmaker Kestenvarn's Photoshop file for the
main map as it existed on 9 Oct 2008 (still here as  bfw-htt-gimp.psd).
XCF is the layered format the GIMP uses for storing images.

The layers contain lots of hidden treasure, including isolated copies
of all the various icons and cartouches and things used to compose the
main map. To edit, hack a layer (you probably should not touch any of
the base maps).  When adding new features, put them in new layers.
Layers are cheap.

The font used for the legends (mostly at 13-point size) is Monotype
Corsiva. We cannot distribute it because it is issued under a
proprietary license, but copies are not hard to find on the Web.  To
fully enable that font in GIMP, copy the downloaded file to your GIMP
fonts directory; this will be something like ~/.gimp-M.N/fonts/, where
M.N is your GIMP version.

To generate maps, simply enable the layers you want and save with the
appropriate file extension.  GIMP will tell you it has to flatten
the layer stack; that's OK.

Here's a link to Kestenvarn's tutorial on mapmaking and the associated
forum thread:

It assumes Photoshop, but some of the advice transfers to GIMP.

The campaign maps in mainline need slightly varying maps depending on
the date; also, some of them have campaign-specific features.  Here's
a description of the layers of great-continent.xcf used to compose each.

All campaigns (Early):
   Border
   Border BG
   Lintanir Label
   Gray Woods Label
   Wesmere Forest Label
   Aethenwood
   Forests
   Marsh
   Lay of the Land

All campaigns after 25YW (Late - this is what's in wesnoth.png):
   Dulatus Hills
   Swamp of Dread Label
   Bitter Swamp Label
   Dulatus Label
   Estmark Hills Label
